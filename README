Gemini is a portable, scalable storage update and retreival system.
The published public interface to the Gemini engine is found in the file
incl/dsmpub.h.

To compile Gemini:
On Unix:
  run the configure script
  make
    The result will be a set of 4 libraries in the libs directory
    that need to be included in the program that uses the engine.
    If you want to make a shared library for Gemini, then run the
  make_so script.

On Windows:
  Use Microsoft Visual Studio and the gemini.dsw file to build
  the gemini.dll library
